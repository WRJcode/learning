>下午好，我是今天的Java面试者，我的中文名叫韦润金，英文名叫Arvin。先介绍我的个人情况。我就读于江门五邑大学网络工程专业，毕业于2020年并取得本科工学位，同时顺利取得全国英语四级证书。在2020年7月到2021年8月在广东创科捷有限公司工作从事java后端研发，从2021.11月至今就业于东莞凯韵科技有限公司从事Java后端。现在描述两个项目，一个是数据可视化屏幕系统，企业在全球有多个办公地点，为实现企业各办公处和部门更有效协同办公，所以开发这块软件。后端与前端都是本人开发，后端主要是应用spirngboot+websocket,前端使用VUE。项目中运用了模板方法、异步、动态创建定时任务等思想。另一个是IOT项目，因为公司产品硬件全面引入IOT模块，为了提高用户体验以及产品竞争力，特开发IOT。我主要开发IOT业务模块、用户模块。后端使用技术是srpingcloudalibaba、nacos、mqtt、rabbitmq。我开发部分运用了工厂设计模式，建造者模式根据主题特征构建不同的主题处理器和主题发布器。由于这是一个多人协同项目，涉及了设备端、app端、云端，就业务流程、开发规范、主题规范、协议选择上，我们就费了一番功夫去沟通交流。最终通过多次会议，技术经理对开发人员进行技术培训逐步解决沟通问题。这就是我对两个项目的概述。以前我学习新知识新技术的渠道是中文书籍、教学视频，几乎很少阅读英文资料；直到去年，公司要做一个带后台管理的微信小程序，前后端、小程序端都是我负责，为了快速学习并进行开发，我通过一手资料来源的官网以及github优秀的开源前端框架快速入门并开发了这个系统。从此我意识到一手来源的官网是最好学习渠道，很多技术如spring系列、redis、mysql等官网以及github都是英文内容，那以后我都在适应中文阅读文档，目前为止能够阅读技术文档。对于我来说能够在英文环境下工作，既是一种挑战也是机遇。英语水平的提升，对于我学习新知识、写代码、阅读源码都会特别有帮助。这是我的自我介绍。

>Good afternoon, I am today's Java interviewer. My Chinese name is Wei Runjin, and my English name is Arvin. First, introduce my personal situation. I majored in network engineering at Jiangmen Wuyi University, and graduated in 2020 with a bachelor's degree in engineering. At the same time, I successfully obtained the National English Test Band 4 Certificate. From July 2020 to August 2021, I worked in Guangdong ChuangKeJie Co., Ltd. and engaged in Java back-end development. From November 2021 to now, I have been employed in Dongguan Kaiyun Technology Co., Ltd. and engaged in Java back-end development. 

> Now describe two projects, one is a data visualization screen system. The enterprise has multiple office locations around the world. In order to achieve more effective collaboration among various offices and departments of the enterprise, this software is developed. Both the back-end and front-end are developed by myself. The back-end is mainly based on the application of springboot+websocket, and the front-end uses VUE. In the project, ideas such as template method, asynchronous, and dynamic creation of scheduled tasks are used. The other is the IOT project, as the company has fully introduced IOT modules into its product hardware. In order to improve the user experience and product competitiveness, IOT is specially developed. I mainly develop IOT business modules and user modules. The backend usage technologies are spring, srping cloudalibaba, nacos, mqtt, and rabbit mq. In my development part, I used the factory design pattern, and the builder pattern builds different topic processors and topic publishers based on the characteristics of the topic. As this is a multi person collaborative project involving device, app, and cloud, we have spent a lot of time communicating and communicating on business processes, development specifications, topic specifications, and protocol selection. Finally, through multiple meetings, technical managers provided technical training to developers to gradually solve communication problems. This is my overview of the two projects. 

>Previously, I learned new knowledge and technology through Chinese books and teaching videos, and rarely read English materials; Until last year, the company wanted to build a WeChat applet with background management, and I was responsible for both the front and back ends and the applet end. In order to quickly learn and develop, I quickly started and developed this system through the official website of a primary source and the excellent open source front-end framework of Github. Since then, I have realized that official websites from primary sources are the best learning channels. Many technologies, such as Spring series, Redis, MySQL, and other official websites, as well as Github, are English content. Since then, I have been adapting to reading documents in Chinese, and so far I have been able to read technical documents. Being able to work in an English language environment is both a challenge and an opportunity for me. The improvement of my English proficiency will be particularly helpful for me to learn new knowledge, write code, and read source code. This is my self introduction.

>Java是面向对象的语言，具有抽象、封装、多态等特性，而设计模式在Java中的应用和体现也基本是基于Java的这三种特性，使用面向对象的思想对现实场景也相对简单。
>Java is an object-oriented language with features such as abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The application of design patterns in Java are also based on these three features. Using object-oriented thinking for real-world scenarios is also relatively simple.

Project Experience ---------------- ----------------- 

Data Large Screen System Java Full Stack Development

Project Description 

With the steady improvement of the company's global business, "Information from offices around the world cannot be effectively communicated due to time differences and various other reasons. To achieve more effective collaboration among offices and departments of enterprises, large data screens have emerged as the times require.". The data large screen system not only personalizes the design of data visualization and information notification billboards for the overall situation of the company, but also personalizes the design of dedicated information billboards for each department. Each Kanban communicates with the server through WebSocket. Whenever managers update data through the background or by stapling, WebSocket sends a request for updates to the corresponding module in a timely manner. Because the data that needs to be managed in the background involves multiple departments, a user role menu resource permission system is designed based on the RBAC permission model to maintain data security and privacy within the department. There are six offices across the country with different time zones, and logical processing has been made for different time zones in timed tasks.

Technology involved 

⚫ Backend technology: Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Task, JWT, MyBatis, Nacos, Maven, Web Socket, Swagger 
⚫ Front end technology: Vue2, Vue X, Vue Router, Axios, Element UI, E-charts 
⚫ Database: MySQL, Redis 

Responsibility Description

➢ As a full stack development, I am independently responsible for the technical selection and architecture design of the data big screen. I am independently responsible for the development and design of the full version of the project from scratch, and highlights of the iterative project. The server establishes communication with the data big screen through WebSocket, and the server proactively notifies the corresponding clients of data updates and changes; Compared to general short link polling updates, it reduces requests to the backend, reduces server pressure, and is more flexible. 

➢ Login uses third-party login to access enterprise nails; Part of the module information allows for unified response, exception management, and field validation exceptions in Spring Boot projects through nailing. Standardized development. Background data updates support Excel table import and batch updates; The news module can generate adaptive long graphs for mobile phones based on URLs, and supports batch generation and optimization using multiple threads. The template method design pattern is used to achieve batch import and processing of data, Improve code cleanliness and scalability 

➢ Use websocket heartbeat mechanism to monitor the status of the machine where the data screen is located 

➢ Support dynamic creation or cancellation of scheduled tasks 

IOT projects Java back-end 

project description 

With the steady improvement of the company's business, in order to improve the user experience and open up new markets, all products of the company have upgraded their hardware, including chips, and all products currently produced will support Iot modules. In order to interface with newly developed products, the information department cooperates with the R&D department to develop their own products that integrate R&D and cloud connectivity. The app side supports Android and Apple, and the server side uses the spring cloud microservice. Message push is conducted through the lightweight mqtt protocol.

Technology involved 

⚫ Backend technology: Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud Alibaba, Spring Boot, Spring Security, MyBatis Plus, Nacos, Maven, RabbitMq, JWT, Swagger, mqtt 
⚫ Front end technology: Vue2, Vue X, Vue Router, axios, Element UI 
⚫ Database: MySQL and Redis 

Responsibility Description 

➢ Participate in demand analysis and discussion on how to implement IOT projects 
➢ Be responsible for server interfaces, such as user modules and IOT modules 
➢ Be responsible for background development project highlights 
➢ Use lightweight mqtt communication, suitable for messaging in low bandwidth, high latency, and unstable network environments to ensure device side stability.
➢ Unified response, exception management, field validation exceptions, and standardized development of the Spring Boot project. 
➢ Adopt microservices and split services by functional modules, ensuring high service availability
